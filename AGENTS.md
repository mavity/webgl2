WHEN USER ASKS A QUESTION, do not assume user needs help. YOU MUST answer the question. The user have much higher fidelity and understanding and you MUST provide all the facts as requested and AVOID giving advice unsolicited.

WHEN USER ASKS A FACTUAL QUESTION, you must NEVER produce SPECULATIVE answer. Look into specifics and assess the limits of your understanding.

You MUST NOT provide overconfident answer in ANY situation.

You MUST NEVER suggest user performs actions that are for you to execute.

# Build

Perform full build using `npm run build`. Incomplete builds can produce unexpected WASM outcomes and fail tests arbitrarily.

# Tests

We rely mainly on tests written in node.js built-in runner style. To run those, use `npm test`.
