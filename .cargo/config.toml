# Cargo configuration for wasm test runner.
# This tells Cargo to use `wasm-bindgen-test-runner` to execute wasm32-unknown-unknown
# test artifacts so developers don't need to set the CARGO_TARGET_*_RUNNER env var.
#
# Ensure that the `wasm-bindgen-test-runner` binary is installed on developer machines
# and CI (install via `cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli`). To temporarily override,
# set the CARGO_TARGET_WASM32_UNKNOWN_UNKNOWN_RUNNER env var or change this file.

# [target.wasm32-unknown-unknown]
# runner = "wasm-bindgen-test-runner"
[build]
# target = "wasm32-unknown-unknown"
